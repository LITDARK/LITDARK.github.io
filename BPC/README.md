# BemaniPatcher-Custom

A Custom version of BEMANIPatcher. Added support for "SOME" game releases.

Live version hosted on [my blog](https://LITDARK.cn/BPC/).

Edited by LITDARK. Original README file below.

>## BemaniPatcher
>A tool to easily apply known hex edits to any binary, with examples for Bemani games.
>
>Should work on most modern browsers.
>
>Live version hosted [on my website](https://mon.im/bemanipatcher/).
>
>## Asking about new patches
>These days, I do not create the patches. Everything is community submitted.
>If you would like new hex edits, make them yourself and make a pull request!
>
>## Patch rules
>- *New*: No n-0 newer than 1 year ago. [Why?](https://github.com/mon/BemaniPatcher/blob/master/docs/why_no_n_minus_zero.md)
>- Rhythm games only. Bombergirl is the one exception, it's Konami anyway.
>- No autoplay patches
>>  - It is far too easy to accidentally get people banned from their networks
>>  - It's mainly used to upload autoplays to YouTube, which is not something I want to be involved with
>
>## Submitting a new game
>Here is your checklist:
>- Add the new game html, it is easiest to copy an existing game and modify it.
  The html should be named `[game][release].html` except IIDX because they just
  happen to be `[release].html` only...
>- Modify the `<title>` tag and the `<h1>` tag to the name of the new game.
>- Modify the patcher for the new DLL names/patches.
>- Keep consistent indentation for the new patches. I will have to fix your PR if
  it contains poor formatting, which will delay the merging process.
>- Modify `index.html` to add the new game. Sorting: alphabetical by game series,
  then in release order per game.
>- Add a game image. 128x128px PNG files, please. Any blank space should be
  either white or transparent.
>
>If your pull request is a single commit, I will rebase and merge. If it is
multiple commits, I will squash and merge.
>
>Please do not worry about submitting "bad" PRs. If there is something wrong, I
will tell you how to fix it or I will fix it myself before merging.
